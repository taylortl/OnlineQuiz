# Online Quiz Application

***About this application*** \
This is an online quiz application for my tutoring part time. The questions will be displayed as multiple choices and the colour of the page changes with the student answer. The student is able to know the correct answer of the question immediately after clicking their own answer. I am implementing this application because I found marking students' practices to be time consuming. With this online application, I am able to update the questions on my end and  my students are able to test themselves in a more efficent manner.
