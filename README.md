# Online Quiz Application

## About this application
This is an online quiz application for my tutoring part time. I found marking the practice tests time consuming, so I intented to create an application for me to upload questions and my students can practise as much as they want. 

At this Stage, the questions are all fetched and selected from Open Trivia Database. I will be implementing a tutor-side of the quiz app, which allows tutor to input their desired questions and the student-side can be updated with the lastest practices.
